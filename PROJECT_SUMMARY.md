## 📧 Email Notification Features

The app sends **automatic email alerts** when politicians make new trades:

### Email Features:
- ✅ HTML formatted with professional styling
- ✅ Color-coded transactions (green=buy, red=sell)
- ✅ Batch notifications (multiple trades in one email)
- ✅ Detailed trade info: ticker, amount, dates, politician
- ✅ No spam - only sends when NEW trades are detected

### How It Works:
1. **Checks** for new trades every hour (configurable)
2. **Compares** with database to find unseen trades
3. **Sends** HTML email with all new trade details
4. **Marks** as notified to prevent duplicates

---

Track any member of Congress by name:
```yaml
politicians:

  # Add anyone!
```

### 2. **Configurable Check Interval**
```yaml
check_interval_minutes: 60  # Every hour

```

### 3. **Email Notifications**

### 5. **Database Tracking**
